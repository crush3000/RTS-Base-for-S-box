<h2 align="center">RTS Base for S&box</h3>

### What is This?
This is a personal project I started building to mess around with the S&box API. The point of it (since I can only do programming and not art) is to make a base project for RTS games in S&box and hopefully provide something useful for someone. As it nears completion (IF it does) it should present a developer with a ready-made Source 2 RTS engine to plug their models and animations into. I'm going to keep plinking away at it as I have time. I'm a full-time computer engineer so this is a hobby thing for me, and I am not quite used to this sort of dev yet. Therefore, comments/critique/pull requests welcome!

### How Can I Use It?
You *SHOULD* be able to just clone it down or download it and then load it up as a S&box project as-is. If not let me know, I probably forgot to push a necessary file or haven't updated it in a while.

### Credits
I did not make the skeleton unit models/animations, I purchased them. I am uploading as little of these as is necessary to demonstrate the mechanics so that I'm not just giving away this dude's stuff.

That said, these assets are brilliant though, made by [this guy](https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/profile/PolygonBlacksmith?count=20&sortBy=effectiveDate&sortDir=DESC&start=0)
